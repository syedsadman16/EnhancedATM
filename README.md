# EnhancedATM

Click on the credit card to begin. The pin number is 4321

-Looking to solve real life problems, I considered the security vulnerabilities that are prevalent in lower income neighborhoods and created a new ATM system simulation with improved security measures.
-Used instances and data structures such as ArrayLists and Hashtables to store user data - just a temporary solution to using a database
-Can implement anonymous calling using Twilio API

The Idea:
Equipped with a tablet UI, the ATM would be able to take pictures and send the user an email during a transaction for security purposes. At any time, if any components are being tampered with or removed, alarm will ring and ATM will lock down until owner uses key to stop it. During use, there is a security feature that activates when the user enters their pin number backwards during a transaction. This will anonymously alert the  police and present the user with a fake screen and print fake currency, tricking the thief.
