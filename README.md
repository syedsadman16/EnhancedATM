# EnhancedATM

Click on the credit card to begin. The pin number is 4321

-Created an idea for a new and improved ATM system because of the vulnerabilities current ATM's have in lower income neighborhoods.

-Used instances and data structures such as ArrayLists and Hashtables to store user input - just a temporary solution instead of using a database


The idea was to create an ATM system that has better security than trditoonal neighborhood ATMs. Equipped with a tablet UI, the ATM would be able to take pictures and send the user an email during a transaction for security purposes. At any time, if any components are being tampered with or removed, alarm will ring and ATM will lock down until owner uses key to stop it. During use, there is a security feature which is enabled if the user enters their pin number backwards while making a transaction. This will anonymously alert the  police and present the user with a fake screen and print fake currency, tricking the thief.
